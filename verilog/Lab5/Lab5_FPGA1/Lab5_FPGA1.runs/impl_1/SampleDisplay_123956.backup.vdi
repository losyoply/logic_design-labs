INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=-52.049| TNS=-1614.092| WHS=0.144  | THS=0.000  |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
